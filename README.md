A CONTRACT-ORIENTD, HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGE WHOSE SYNTAX IZ SIMILAR 2 DAT OV [LOLCODE](http://lolcode.org/) AN IT DESIGND 2 TARGET TEH ETHEREUM VIRTUAL MACHINE (EVM)

## BUT HOW THO?
1. Learn about parsing, lexing, & compilers.
1. Learn a bunch more about the EVM and how bytecode works.
1. Define some [lexical gramar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_grammar).
1. Map to required EVM bytecode.
1. Backward engineer a compiled LOLCHAIN contract to match the critical parts of a compiled solidity contract.
